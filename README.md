In this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project, we'll extract data from a CSV file, transform it into a Pandas DataFrame, and then load it into an Azure SQL Database. To accomplish this, we'll use Python and a few libraries, such as Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and pyodbc.

# Prerequisites
1.  An Azure account with an active subscription
2.  An Azure SQL Database instance
3.  Python 3.x installed on your machine
4.  Required libraries installed (pandas, sqlalchemy, 

# Steps
1. Install the required Python libraries:
pyodbc)

```
pip install pandas sqlalchemy pyodbc
```

2. Create a Python script (etl_project.py):

Replace the placeholders (your_csv_file.csv, username, password, server, database_name, and destination_table) with your specific values.

3. Run the script:
```
python etl_project.py
```
This script will extract the data from the CSV file, transform it into a Pandas DataFrame, and then load it into the specified Azure SQL Database table. Make sure you have the required access to the Azure SQL Database to create or update tables.
